### Overview

On this page you will find some information and tips about the fan above the heatsink of the processor.

The fan that cools the Ryzen&trade; processor of the UDOO BOLT GEAR is a 5V powered fan with PWM signal speed management and is managed entirely by the board's Embedded Controller.

The full management of the fan settings described below is possible starting from BIOS/UEFI Firmware version 1.07.  
<span class="label label-warning">Heads up!</span>  Please, always keep updated the BIOS/UEFI Firmware of your UDOO BOLT GEAR to have the latest features and bugfix available.  


### BIOS/UEFI Fan Settings

Here a detailed description of the fan settings and its default values.


      Advanced

              Enhanced 3 wire RPM measurement        <Disabled>
              Automatic Temperature FAN Control      <Enabled>
                AC0 Temperature (C)                  <85>
                AC1 Temperature (C)                  <70>
                Temperature Hysteresis               5

**Enhanced 3 wire RPM measurement** refers to an algorithm necessary for the consistent reading of the current fan speed to respond to the tachometer signal. This data is made available by [EAPI libraries](!/BIOS-UEFI_and_Tools/EAPI). The algorithm set the speed fan to 100% for 100 milliseconds every 3 seconds. This is the standard way for the 3 wires fan to have a consistent reading of the speed. By default it is disabled because it can create a perceptible non-linear motion sound effect on some fans or some assembly situations.

**AC0 Temperature** indicates the temperature above which the fan start turns on at full 100% rotation speed.

**AC1 Temperature** indicates the temperature above which the fan start turns on at the % rotation speed indicated by the *FAN Duty Cycle (%) Above AC1* value.

**Temperature Hysteresis** This value is added to AC0 and AC1 when temperature is growing and subtracted when it is lowering to avoid oscillation.

**FAN Duty Cycle (%) Above AC1** is the percentage speed at which the fan turns when the processor's temperature is in the range between AC1 and AC0.

**Speed change duration** indicates the time with which the speed changes linearly from one speed value to another (it is a ramp in practice, if set to 0 the fan will start directly at the right speed, if other values are set the fan will start more slowly and arrive at the selected speed more gradually).

<span class="label label-info">Info</span> Preset values above are designed for a normal desktop working environment. These settings help minimize fan noise while keeping the system properly cooled in a normal working environment. The default settings may be modified in future BIOS revisions as UDOO continues to fine-tune them to get the best trade-off between cooling and fan acoustics.  
You may need to change the fan settings if your usage model includes any of the following:

* Heavy image/video processing or analysis.
* Gaming, Stress testing or Benchmarking.
* Sustained processor usage of 75% or higher, for a long period.

If you are in one of these usage scenarios, we suggest raising the value of **FAN Duty Cycle % Above AC1** and lowering the **AC1 Temperature** and **AC0 Temperature** to maintain a lower processor operating temperature and be sure to always use maximum performance.

if the fan is changed to one that does <strong>not handle PWM</strong> rotation speed, it is important for proper fan operation to set the values for <strong>FAN Duty Cycle % Above AC1</strong> to <strong>100</strong> and <strong>Speed change duration</strong> to <strong>0</strong>.
