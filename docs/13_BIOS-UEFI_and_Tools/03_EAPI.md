EAPI (Embedded Application Programming Interface) is a framework
developed by *PICMGÂ®* for *COM Express* modules that gives a common API to unify
software control for:
- System information
- Watchdog timer
- I2C Bus
- Flat Panel brightness control
- User storage area
- GPIO

The EAPI definition is open to be used for other embedded form factors too,
such as SBCs. Read the full specification [here][specs].
Basically you need to include/implement these libraries in you software code to
communicate with the Embedded Controller and use the pinout functionalities.
