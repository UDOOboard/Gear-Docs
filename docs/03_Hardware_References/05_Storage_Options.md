### M.2 SATA/PCIe x2 Slot: Socket 2 Key B type 2242/3042/2260

UDOO BOLT features an M.2 SSD Slot, which allows plugging **M.2 Socket 2 Key B** Solid State Drives with **SATA** interface or **PCI-e x2** interface (*PCI-e x1* is also supported).

The connector used for the M.2 SATA/PCI-e slot is *CN18*, is a standard 75 pin M.2 Key B connector, located at the bottom of the board.

On the UDOO BOLT board there is also a Threaded Spacer which allows the placement of M.2 Socket 2 Key B SATA/PCI-e modules in `2260` size.

It is possible to also place modules in `2242` or `3042` size, by using a M/F Spacer, which allows fixing the M.2 module on the spacer already available on the PCB, deemed for the fixing of the M.2 Key E.

In the [Official Accessories](!Accessories/Official_Accessories) section you can find a *M.2 SSD Transcend MTS600 2260* drive compatible with this connector, available in the UDOO shop.

### M.2 PCIe x4 NVMe Slot: Socket 3 Key M Type 2280

Another possibility to connect mass storage devices is given by the **M.2 Key M Slot**, which allows the plugging of super fast M.2 High Capacity SSD NVMe drives with **PCI-e x4** interface.

The connector used for the M.2 SSD slot is *CN17*, which is a standard *75 pin M.2 Key M* connector, located at the bottom of the board.

On the UDOO BOLT board there is also a Threaded Spacer which allows the placement of M.2 Socket 3 Key M PCI-e SSD modules in `2280` size.

### SATA

The AMD Ryzenâ„¢ Embedded V1000 family of Processors embed a SATA Controller, which offers two **SATA III 6.0 Gbps** interfaces.

Of these interfaces, one SATA channel is carried out to a standard male S-ATA connector, *CN14* (the other SATA channel is available on the M.2 Key B socket).

A dedicated power connector *CN15*, can be used to give supply to *2.5"* Hard Disk Drives (or Solid State Drives) connected to the SATA male connector.  
The dedicated power connector is a 4-pin male connector. You can find this cable in the [SATA data and power cables](http://shop.udoo.org/sata-data-and-power-cables-for-udoo-x86.html) kit.

<span class="label label-warning">Heads up!</span> To connect a *3.5"* Hard Drive you need to provide SATA +5V+12V combo power supply from an external source.
