# Input
You can power up the board in 2 ways:

* **19V DC Power Jack** min 3.15A (60W) for basic functionalities.
* 2x **USB Type-C** power in. PD sink profile 20V/3A(60W).

A bicolour Green/Yellow LED is placed near the DC IN power jack (CN5) to signal the power state of the board.  
When the board is powered but turned off, then the LED turns on Yellow, during normal working (S0 State) the LED turns on Green light.

## DC Power Jack
The UDOO BOLT board can be supplied with an external **19VDC Â± 5%** power supply, minimum **60W** (i.e. min. *3.15A @ 19V*) for basic functionalities recommended.

<span class="label label-warning">Heads up!</span> Always make sure that the power cable is less than *3mt.* long.

This voltage can be supplied through a DC power jack (CN5).

**Mating DC** plug is a male connector **4.5mm x 3.0mm with pin inside**.

<span class="label label-warning">Heads up!</span> CE and FCC certifications retained using only the UDOO BOLT qualified Power Supply you can find in the UDOO Shop. When not using UDOO Gear qualified Power Supply, use 19VDC (min 60W power) PSUs certified for your country
