# UDOO BOLT GEAR
**UDOO BOLT GEAR** is a portable, breakthrough supercomputer that goes up to *3.6 GHz* thanks to the brand-new **AMD Ryzen&trade; Embedded V1000 SoC**, a top-notch APU, multicore CPU with powerful integrated mobile GPU - *AMD Radeon&trade; Vega 8* - and an integrated **Arduino&reg; Leonardo-compatible** platform, all wrapped into one.

On **UDOO BOLT GEAR** you can run all the software available for the PC world, from gaming to video streaming, from graphical editors to professional development platforms, plus all the software for the Arduino&reg; Leonardo world, including all the sketches, libraries and the official Arduino&reg; IDE.

UDOO BOLT GEAR embeds two processors:
* the new [**AMD Ryzen&trade; Embedded V1000**](https://www.amd.com/en/products/embedded-ryzen-v1000-series), *V1605B*, 14nm, *4-cores/8-threads* CPU, with a thermal design power of just *12-25W*, designed for really fast Ultrathin Notebooks. This processor family brings together the breakthrough performance of the pioneering *AMD “Zen” CPU* and *AMD “Vega” GPU* architectures in a seamlessly-integrated SoC solution that sets a new standard in processing power for next-generation embedded designs.
* the [**Microchip ATmega32U4**](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATmega32u4) 8-bit AVR microcontroller, the same of *Arduino&reg; Leonardo*.

While the AMD Ryzen&trade; Embedded V1000 processor can run all the Windows 10 and Linux 64-bit Distros you want to use as desktop PC, the Microchip ATmega32U4 allows easy access to a Arduino&reg; Leonardo environment.  
The main AMD Ryzen&trade; processor and the ATmega32u4 microcontroller are connected together through an internal USB serial connection, so it is exactly like you have an Arduino&reg; Leonardo connected with a standard PC but all in small size form factor Single Board Computer.

Download the [**User Manual**](https://udoo.org/download/files/UDOO_BOLT/Doc/UDOO_BOLT_MANUAL.pdf) to have more complete explanation of the UDOO BOLT GEAR hardware and features.  
Here you can find the [Get Started and Safety instruction Manual](https://udoo.org/download/files/UDOO_BOLT/Doc/UDOO_BOLT_get_started_v1.8.pdf) for a quick installation.

<span class="label label-warning">Heads up!</span> In order to prevent damages to your board, remember to:

* CE and FCC certifications retained using only the UDOO BOLT GEAR qualified Power Supply. When not using UDOO BOLT GEAR qualified Power Supply, use 19VDC (min 60W power) PSUs certified for your country (make sure that the power cable is less than 3 mt. long).
* CE and FCC certifications retained with the board inside the UDOO BOLT GEAR metal case.
* This product should be operated in a well-ventilated environment and, if used inside a case, the case should not be covered.
* This product should be elevated on a stable, flat, electrically non-conductive surface whilst in operation, and clear from any object that can induce a short-circuit.
* Do not expose it to water, moisture or heat from any source; UDOO BOLT GEAR is designed for reliable operation at normal ambient room temperatures.
* Avoid handling the warm and moving parts (like the fan) and generally the printed circuit board while it is powered.
* Only handle by the edges to minimise the risk of electrostatic discharge damage.
* Take care whilst handling to avoid mechanical or electrical damage to the printed circuit board and connectors. Also use a grounded wrist strap or touch a safely grounded object before you handle components.
* Never provide more than 5V in input to the GPIOs of the Arduino Leonardo-compatible(Atmel&reg; ATmega32U4), and never provide more than 3.3V in input to the GPIOs of the Embedded Controller.
* Do not use a *NON*-standard USB 3.0 peripheral. If you use a non-standard USB 3.0 peripheral with an external power plug, this could send back the power source to the UDOO BOLT GEAR board with the risk of damage.
* The most important safety rule of all: **Always Be Careful! (ABC)**
