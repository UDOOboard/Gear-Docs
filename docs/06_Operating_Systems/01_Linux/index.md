**UDOO BOLT GEAR** is a Single Board Computer based on the **AMD Ryzen&trade; Embedded V1000** family of System-on-Chips (SoCs), a series of Dual or Quad Core, 14nm, SoCs with **64-bit instruction set** and very low TDP.

The **UDOO BOLT GEAR** supports all the *x86 Linux* distributions **64-bit**(aka x64, x86-64, x86_64).
We suggest to always use a **64-bit** OS version.

In the [Getting Started](https://www.udoo.org/get-started-bolt/) section you can find a guide of how to install a Linux distro, the example is based on the Ubuntu OS.

<span class="label label-warning">Heads up!</span> There is a **known issue** with amdgpu driver which comes with 18.04 LTS and maybe others Linux distros. During and after OS
installation it is possible that you may receive a UI after login or you may not.  
Check the [Known issues](!Operating_Systems/Linux/Known_issues) section to know how to deal with it.

If you are looking for the **Linux Drivers for the V1000 Processors** you can check the [**Linux Drivers**](!Operating_Systems/Linux/Drivers) section.

<span class="label label-warning">Heads up!</span> The AMD processors of the UDOO BOLT GEAR and the Wi-Fi/BT module are released only few time ago so we suggest to use a recent distribution to find all the latest drivers already installed and all working properly.

## Famous Linux distributions

Here you can find an unordered list of 10 of the most popular Linux distributions:

* [**Ubuntu**](https://www.ubuntu.com/): is probably the most well-known Linux distribution. Ubuntu is based on Debian, but it has its own software repositories. Much of the software in these repositories is synced from Debian’s repositories. **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Focal Fossa** is the latest Ubuntu released versionand the latest Long Term Support version with a support end of life on April 2025. In the [V-Series V1000 Drivers & Support | AMD ](https://www.amd.com/en/support/embedded/amd-ryzen-embedded-v-series-processors/v-series-v1000-radeon-vega-graphics) page you can find AMD GPU PRO stable drivers to support **Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS**. Different famous flavor distros can be downloaded from the Ubuntu website such as Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Ubuntu Studio, UbuntuDDE and so on.

* [**Linux Mint**](http://linuxmint.com/) is a Linux distribution built on top of Ubuntu. It uses Ubuntu’s software repositories, so the same packages are available on both. Originally, Mint was an alternative distribution loved mainly because it included media codecs and proprietary software that Ubuntu didn’t include by default.  

* [**Debian**](https://www.debian.org/) is an operating system composed only of free, open-source software. The Debian project has been operating since 1993 — over 20 years ago! This widely respected project is still releasing new versions of Debian, but it’s known for moving much more slowly than distributions like Ubuntu or Linux Mint. This can make it more stable and conservative, which is ideal for some systems.  

* [**Arch Linux**](https://www.archlinux.org/) is more old school than many of the other Linux distributions here. It’s designed to be flexible, lightweight, minimal, and to “Keep it Simple.” Keeping it simple doesn’t mean Arch provides tons of graphical utilities and automatic configuration scripts to help you set up your system. Instead, it means Arch dispenses with that stuff and gets out of your way.

* [**Fedora**](http://fedoraproject.org/) is a project with a strong focus on free software — you won’t find an easy way to install proprietary graphics drivers here, although third-party repositories are available. Fedora is bleeding edge and contains the latest versions of software.

* [**CentOS**](http://www.centos.org/) / [**Red Hat Enterprise Linux**](http://www.redhat.com/products/enterprise-linux/) Red Hat Enterprise Linux is a commercial Linux distribution intended for servers and workstations. It’s based on the open-source Fedora project, but is designed to be a stable platform with long-term support. CentOS and Red Hat recently announced they’re collaborating, so CentOS is now part of Red Hat itself.

* [**openSUSE**](http://www.opensuse.org/en/) / [**SUSE Linux Enterprise**](https://www.suse.com/) openSUSE is a community-created Linux distribution sponsored by Novell. Novell purchased SuSE Linux in 2003, and they still create an enterprise Linux project known as SUSE Linux Enterprise. Where Red Hat has the Fedora project that feeds into Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Novell has the openSUSE project that feeds into SUSE Linux Enterprise.

* [**Mageia**](https://www.mageia.org/en/) and [**Mandriva**](http://www.mandriva.com/en/) Mageia is a fork of Mandriva Linux created in 2011. Mandriva — known as Mandrake before that — was once one of the great user-friendly Linux distributions.

* [**Slackware Linux**](http://www.slackware.com/) is another institution. Founded in 1993, Slackware is the oldest Linux distribution that’s still maintained and putting out new releases today.

* [**Puppy Linux**](http://puppylinux.org/) is another fairly well-known Linux distribution. Previous versions have been built on Ubuntu, but the latest is built on Slackware. Puppy is designed to be a small, lightweight operating system that can run well on very old computers.

Others useful distributions:

* [**LibreELEC – Just enough OS for KODI**](https://libreelec.tv/) Kodi is a free and open-source media player software application developed by the XBMC Foundation. LibreELEC (short for Libre Embedded Linux Entertainment Center) is a distro based on Kodi, is a non-profit fork of OpenELEC as an open source just enough OS (JeOS) Linux software appliance distro for Kodi.  

* [**Lakka**](http://www.lakka.tv/) is a lightweight Linux distribution that transforms a computer into a full blown game console for retrogaming.
