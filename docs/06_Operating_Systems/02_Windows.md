UDOO BOLT GEAR is a Single Board Computer based on the **AMD Ryzen&trade; Embedded V1000** family of System-on-Chips (SoCs), a series of Dual or Quad Core, 14nm, SoCs with **64-bit instruction set** and very low TDP.

Thanks to the x86_64 instruction set, the **UDOO BOLT GEAR** supports the *Windows 10* distribution for **32-bit**(aka i386, IA-32, x86-32, x86_32) and **64-bit**(aka x64, x86-64, x86_64).

We suggest to always use a **64-bit** Windows 10 version.

<span class="label label-warning">Heads up!</span> Please notice that usually you need a 64-bit OS version to exploit more than 4GB of RAM. Total amount of memory available with a 32-bit OS depends on the OS itself (less than 4GB, however). If you installed more than 4GB, please use a 64-bit version of Windows 10.

In the [Getting Started](https://www.udoo.org/get-started-x86/)  you can find a guide on how to install Windows, the example is based on Windows® 10 64-bit.

<span class="label label-warning">Heads up!</span> The AMD processors of the UDOO BOLT GEAR were released recently so we suggest to always keep updated Windows® 10 64-bit version and the AMD drivers to insure all features work properly.
